I tracked the time it took to transfer a large, 100MB file by  first truncating the file into BIMDC and using the time ./client -f test.bin command.
the real time was 30.188s
the user time was 8.483s
the system time was 38.029 s

the main bottleneck is the fact there are many read and write procedures between the client and the server. Moreover, each read and write procedure is limited to the MAX_MESSAGE. As a result the many number of switches slows the transfer procedure.

These are some more points of different sized files and how long they took to transfer.
